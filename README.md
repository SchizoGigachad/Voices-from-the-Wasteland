Voices from the Wasteland is a lore-expanding mod for Cataclysm: Bright Nights that adds hundreds of in-world notes, journals, letters, and logs scattered across the ruins of a dying civilization.

These notes are written by survivors, military personnel, scientists, criminals, conspiracy theorists, and moreâ€”each providing a unique glimpse into the chaos, fear, and unraveling of society during the Cataclysm. From desperate last words to classified research memos, and from cultic ramblings to grim battlefield reports, every entry helps paint a deeper, more immersive picture of the post-apocalyptic world.

Whether you're scavenging an abandoned lab or picking through the remains of a ransacked house, the voices left behind will tell stories the dead no longer can.
